TestNG will execute the test files in alphabetic order by default.

What is the difference between @Test    and   @Test() ?
They will work both the same the only difference if we want to parameterize our Test annotations we should write it
as Test().

What is @BeforeMethod?
this method will execute before every test.

What is @AfterMethod?
this method will execute after every test.

what is the usage of @Before and @After ?  For code Re-Usability
They are used for preConditions and PostConditions meaning if they are are some conditions that we would like to
repeat in every test then by help of @Before and @After methods we could write it once and repeat them for our entire
test cases. forExample for every test case we should launch the browser and quite the browser so why we should repeat them
in every test .
